## Insert Asset Plugin (For ROBLOX Studio)

This is a small quick plugin I wrote a while ago. It doesn't work like it used to but you can insert ROBLOX created models, hats, gear etc. and models you already acquired on your user account.

I don't even know if the plugin even works anymore. I'll try to fix it though.
