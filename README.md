## Insert Service Plugin (For ROBLOX Studio)

This is a plugin I wrote a while ago. It doesn't work like it used to but you can insert ROBLOX created models,hats,gear etc.

I don't even know if the plugin even works anymore. I'll try to make it work though. 

I also removed all the deprecated methods...*COUGH* :Remove() *COUGH* and replaced them with new methods.
