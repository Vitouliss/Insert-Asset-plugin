## Insert Asset Plugin (For ROBLOX Studio)

This is a small quick plugin I wrote a while ago. This plugin can insert models you have acquired on your account, and all hats, gears, faces, etc. 

# Installation
There is currently no way to upload a Gui to GitHub, so you have to grab it yourself (https://www.roblox.com/library/4128982063/inputGui). Create a model, put both the plugin's script and the Gui inside and save it to your local plugins folder.
